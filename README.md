# Convert_heic
### Convenience Points ###
It is very convenient because it can convert multiple images and the converted images are stored in a file named png_XXXX(date).
The folder location is generated in the directory of the selected image.
This program converts Apple's proprietary ".heic" file extension to ".png".

### CAUTION  ###
There is "heic.app" in dist, but it does not work properly.
Please use "python3 heic.py" or "unix file" to run it.
